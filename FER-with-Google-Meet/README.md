# Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in Virtual Classrooms

A 2nd year Capstone Project

# Project Overview:
<br>
This project aims to develop a real-time Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system that can be integrated into virtual classrooms, such as Google Meet, to enhance online learning experiences. By detecting and analyzing students' facial expressions during online classes, the system provides teachers with real-time feedback on students' emotional states. This allows educators to adapt their teaching methods dynamically, improving student engagement, reducing frustration, and creating a more effective learning environment.
